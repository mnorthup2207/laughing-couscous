                <h4>The Independent Coasting Advantage</h4>
                <p>
                    da Vinci Designs’ Independent Coasting System (ICS) offers you a riding experience both on
                    and
                    off
                    road that equals or surpasses the best you’ve had on a single or tandem bike. The ICS makes
                    for
                    a
                    far more intuitive, comfortable and efficient ride. This newfound ability to independently
                    or
                    collectively coast, pedal and position your cranks at will offers these advantages:

                            <li>Captain and stoker can independently relax, take a drink, adjust seat position, stand
                                for a few seconds to relieve weary sit bones, even take a moment to gaze at scenery,
                                while the other keeps pedaling.</li>
                            <li>Traversing obstacles is easier and more efficient because the captain and stoker can
                                coordinate avoiding the obstacles while maintaining forward momentum.</li>
                            <li>Asynchronous pedaling decreases strain on the final drivetrain.</li>

                    <strong>The main component of da Vinci Designs’ ICS</strong> is an intermediate drive shaft six
                    inches
                    in front of the
                    rear bottom bracket. The intermediate shaft has two single-speed freewheels on the left side that
                    are
                    independently driven by the cranks at twice the rotating speed and half the torque. On the right
                    side of
                    the shaft, four <strong>Hyperglide™</strong> cogs drive the bike. The chain rings are half the size
                    as
                    those on a
                    conventional tandem because of the double rotation of the intermediate shaft. The combination of
                    12-,
                    18-, 24-, 30-tooth driving gears equals 24-, 36-, 48-, 60-tooth chain rings. The combination of the
                    small 6-tooth gap, doubled rotation and the Hyperglide cogs gives da Vinci Designs’ tandems these
                    technical advantages:

                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>Smooth and fast front shifting – The closer the chain rings are to the same size, the easier it
                        is to
                        shift. Other tandems, and even single bikes, are forced to use a 12-tooth gap between chain
                        rings.

                <div class="col-md">
                    <p>Unprecedented range of gears – Four chain rings and eight rear sprockets mean 32 gears that range
                        from 18 to 140 gear-inches. No other tandem gives you that many gears or that kind of range.

                    <p>More ground clearance – Nice when you lift your tandem over a curb, out of a truck, or when you
                        are
                        off road.
