            <p>
                Located in Denver Colorado, Session Coffee is being built on the same high standards the Denver coffee
                market prides itself on. Ethical sourcing of green coffee, locally sourced food and milk, and creating a
                professional atmosphere for baristas to thrive.</p>
            <p>The practice of crafting better coffee is nothing new, but its demand is ever expanding and its potential
                under-realized. Facing heavy competition from large coffee chains, the Denver specialty market relies on
                pushing higher standards combined with community collaboration. This allows for the customer to make a
                more conscious purchasing decision. </p>
