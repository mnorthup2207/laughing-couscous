Portfolio 2.0

## Portfolio

This is my second  instalment of a portfolio. This time I used almost solely bootsrap elements and was very happy with the turn out. I tried to use as little css styling as possible and let bootsraps grids and elements command the page. I also tried to gear this portfolio more to waht I hope my final portfolio will be. In this idea, I went with a sleak simple layout, that was very minimal. 

## Major Take-Aways

I realized just how powerful bootstrap is as and its many different components. Also really using dev tools in google to "turn off" or override bootstrap coloring or change elements. 


## Shout-Outs

This time around I really only used Bootstrap as a guide in building this website. I don't believe I looked at any other resources for help or guidance. 

## Short-Comings

This portfolio, however looking better than the last, has an insane load time. I'd like to understand why that might be. I also need to look at a wider variety of website to understand a what a better looking website might be. Not so cookie cutter.
